In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important in the healthcare industry, with researchers and healthcare providers alike recognizing the potential of AI to revolutionize medical research and patient care. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of AI and healthcare, and introduce the purpose of this book.

Overview of Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare
--------------------------------------------------

Artificial intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. In healthcare, AI technologies are being used to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns and trends, and make more accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations.

Some of the key areas where AI is being used in healthcare include:

* Medical imaging and diagnostics
* Drug discovery and development
* Health monitoring and tracking
* Personalized medicine
* Digital health solutions

As AI technologies continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, the potential benefits for healthcare are enormous, including faster and more accurate diagnoses, more effective treatments, and improved patient outcomes.

Purpose of the Book
-------------------

The purpose of this book is to provide an in-depth examination of the ways in which AI is currently being used in healthcare, and how it is transforming medical research and patient care. We will explore the latest advances in AI technologies, including machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and blockchain technology, and examine case studies of AI applications in healthcare today.

Through this book, we hope to provide healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers with a better understanding of the potential of AI in healthcare, as well as the challenges and ethical considerations that need to be taken into account. By staying up-to-date with the latest developments in AI and healthcare, we can work together to ensure that these technologies are leveraged to their full potential, ultimately leading to better healthcare outcomes for patients around the world.
